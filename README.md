# StringBuilder-in-JAVA
In Java, a StringBuilder is a class used to create mutable (modifiable) strings. Unlike String, which creates an immutable string, StringBuilder allows you to append, insert, or modify the contents of a string without creating new string objects. This is especially useful when you have to perform many string manipulations.
